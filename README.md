# 🧠 Math-Solver: Hackathon Round 1 Submission

## 📌 Overview
This project solves reasoning and math-based multiple-choice questions by predicting the correct option using a machine learning pipeline.  
It uses **TF-IDF for feature extraction** and **Logistic Regression for classification**.

## ✅ Problem Statement
Given:
- `train.csv` → Contains questions, options, and correct answers.
- `test.csv` → Contains questions and options without correct answers.

Goal:
- Predict the correct option for each question in `test.csv`.
- Save predictions in `output.csv` in the format:
