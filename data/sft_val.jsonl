{"prompt": "You are a careful math/reasoning solver.\nChoose the correct option number from the given choices.\n\nQuestion:\nWithin a factory, there are 5 machines that are programmed to finish a product in exact sequence. Each machine adds a component to the product in the following order: Machine A -> Machine B -> Machine C -> Machine D -> Machine E. To improve efficiency, the technicians realized that adding components B and C can be swapped without compromising the product. They plan to rearrange the order to minimize the time taken for the products to pass from one machine to another, considering the distance between machines is critical. The distances between machines are as follows: A to B is 10m, B to C is 15m, C to D is 5m, D to E is 20m, and swapping B and C will place them 25m apart but reduce A to C and B to D distances to 5m each. If the product must go through A, then B or C (whichever is first), then the remaining B or C, followed by D, then E, what is the new sequence that minimizes the total distance traveled by the products?\n\nOptions:\n1) A-C-B-D-E\n2) A-B-C-D-E\n3) B-A-C-D-E\n4) C-A-B-D-E\n5) Another answer\n\nRespond strictly as: Answer: <number>\nFor example: Answer: 3\n", "completion": "Answer: 5"}
